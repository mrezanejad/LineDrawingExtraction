# LineDrawingExtraction
Automatic line drawing extraction from scenes/images using logical/linear operators framework.

This is part of my Ph.D. work and the codes would be soon uploaded to this git repository (please either check the page again in a couple of weeks or write me an email at: morteza@cim.mcgill.ca).
