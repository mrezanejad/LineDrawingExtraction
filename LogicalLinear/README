INTRODUCTION:
============

These files represent a complete implementation of the Logical/Linear
image operators defined in the paper "Logical/Linear Operators for
Image Curves" by Lee Iverson and Steven W. Zucker to be published in
an upcoming PAMI (also available as
ftp://ftp.cim.mcgill.ca/pub/people/leei/loglin/loglin.ps.gz).  The
implementation is both fast and general, written in portable C.

When compiled, the program pgmloglin will take PGM (portable gray map)
input files and produce a machine readable PostScript file describing
the oriented features in the image.  The program will selectively
compute any or all of the edge, bright line and dark line labels in
the image.

If you try this software out, send me E-mail <leei@ai.sri.com>, and let
me know what you think.


INSTALLATION:
============

The Makefile currently requires GNU make, which is available at:

	ftp://aeneas.mit.edu/pub/gnu/make-3.74.tar.gz

Compilation should be as simple as executing:

	./configure
	make

This will construct three executables (pgmloglin, pgmcxconv, and
make-kern) and the library libloglin.a.

If you wish to compile for a number of different architectures or
operting systems, this may be easily achieved by making subdirectories
of this one (e.g irix4, irix4, sunos4, linux, ...) and then changing
to them and then running configure.  For example:

	mkdir linux
	cd linux
	../configure
	make

Once this has completed, installation may be achieved by a simple
'make install' which, by default, places the appropriate files under
/usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/include, and
/usr/local/man.  This destination can be changed by running configure
with a --prefix=<dir> argument (e.g. --prefix=$(HOME)).


FTP AVAILABILITY:
================

The canonical location for the most recent version of this software
is:

	ftp://ftp.cim.mcgill.ca/pub/people/leei/loglin.tar.gz


RELATED SOFTWARE
================

To convert to/from the PGM image format, use Jef Poskanzer's free
PBMPLUS image software, which provides many useful operations on
PPM-format image files.  You can obtain this package by FTP from
ftp.ee.lbl.gov (pbmplus*.tar.Z).  There is also a newer update of this
package called NETPBM, available from ftp.x.org 
(/contrib/utilities/netpbm*) or wuarchive.wustl.edu under
directory /graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM/.


BUGS:
====

Bugs or compilation errors should be reported to:

	Lee Iverson <leei@ai.sri.com>

Please include the following information:
	* System architecture and OS version.
	* Output of ./configure
	* Output of make
	* Any gdb/dbx traceback as appropriate.


TO DO:
=====

+ Improve documentation.
+ Speedup convolution (?).
+ Examples of uses of output.
